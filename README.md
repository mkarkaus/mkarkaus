### Hiya! 👋

You've landed on a github page of a big time tech enthusiast and former software developer student of 42 school [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) :book: that enjoys working with people. The harsh "zero mistakes" mentality of 42 curriculum has definitely made me be mindful of seemingly small things. Currently I'm working in C on [Corewar](https://github.com/mkarkaus/Corewar), the last project of the first part of algorithm branch.

:small_blue_diamond: 42 Project called [Lem-in](https://github.com/mkarkaus/Lem_in) is my latest feat of C language :small_blue_diamond:

My current software engineering expertise lies in:
- C ⭐
- C++ ⚡

but I've loved every second of coding with:
- Python :snake:
- Ruby :gem:
- Javascript :desktop_computer:
- PHP :page_with_curl:

Other technologies that I'm familiar with include Unix, MySQL, Docker, HTML and CSS.

My freetime usually consists of trying out new coding languages or discovering neat technologies online :computer: or through my network. I also enjoy video games :video_game:, frisbee golf :flying_disc: and other sports. Extensive background in competitive international badminton :badminton: gave me mental skills to pursue new interests and persevere despite roadbumps. The love for sports has stayed with me to this day.
